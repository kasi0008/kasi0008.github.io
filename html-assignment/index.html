        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! Myself Shifa and I am from India. Currently I am enrolled in Interactive Media Design program. I did Bachelor's in Computer Application. I learnt a lot of languages like C, C++, JAVA, PYTHON, ANDROID and so on.My interest in website design and development was since I took the bachelor’s after high school. Thru this course I will learn deeply about the concept and dive into my tech-savvy world.<br><br> After getting a lot of experience, my biggest wish is to apply in “Google Company” for the role of web designer and developer. Coding is my diehard interest and I’m glad about that as well as I like to do experiments with coding and make it complex. I think I have ability to recreate something that already exist. If I get a chance, then I would like to become an UIUX designer too. As an extracurricular activity, I have a little thought of business that is related to handmade art and I will go for after my studies.</p>
