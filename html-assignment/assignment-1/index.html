        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hello! Myself Shifa and I am from India. Currently I am enrolled in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program. I did Bachelor's in Computer Application. I learnt a lot of languages like C, C++, JAVA, PYTHON, ANDROID and so on.My interest in website design and development was since I took the bachelor’s after high school. Thru this course I will learn deeply about the concept and dive into my tech-savvy world.<br><br> After getting a lot of experience, my biggest wish is to apply in <em>“Google Company”</em> for the role of web designer and developer. Coding is my diehard interest and I’m glad about that as well as I like to do experiments with coding and make it complex. I think I have ability to recreate something that already exist. If I get a chance, then I would like to become an UIUX designer too. As an extracurricular activity, When I was in the 10<sup>th</sup>, I have a little thought of business that is related to handmade art and I will go for after my studies.</p>
